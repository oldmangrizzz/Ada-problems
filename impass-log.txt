Speaker 5:
Good evening. My name is Parks. I'm a member of the leadership team. How can I help you today?
Speaker 1:
Hi there. Sorry. I'll ask that you bear with me just a little bit. I am injured. I have a brain injury.
I was a paramedic for Yep. Twenty years before, uh-huh, getting to enjoy all of this. Sorry. My name is Robert Hanson, and I'm calling y'all because I really I I want to try and work out this problem that we seem to have. Let me kinda give you the backstory.
Speaker 3:
Okay.
Speaker 1:
Earlier this year, somewhere at the December, very January 1, it was it was right about the turn of the year, I received a promotional contact from y'all saying, hey. Come to Spectrum. We will do Internet, home, phones. You get to upgrade anytime, and it'll be at this price. And with where I was in life, especially having just come off of the thirty three month long waiting process for Mhmm.
Disability approval, I decided to go ahead and proceed with that. I would find out upon joining y'all's network that that actually wasn't the case, that they told me I would have to wait at least a month, possibly a couple of months before I would be qualified for that plan. Since then, I have had my phone broken, my watch through unfortunate parenting circumstances got lost and when I tried to repair or replace those items, I was unable to and I was told that the reason I could not and the reason that I would not be able to participate in the upgrade anytime plan is due to the fact that my credit is just absolutely atrocious. That's where I've got a pretty serious problem at that point. These are not luxury items.
These are medical devices. I use them to monitor my care twenty four seven every day, all day. If I'm asleep, they're monitoring. If I'm awake, they're monitoring. If I'm out and about in the world, they're monitoring, and they're reporting back to my system and to my health care team.
Now aside from the issue with the promotional plan that never worked out, since coming here, I have had a little bit of trouble keeping my Internet established because I get paid by the federal government between the 27 the month and the 3 the month. I do not have a choice in that. That is not something that I can affect. That is determined by The United States Of America. And my auto pay that y'all forced me to sign up for is set for the twenty first.
Well, I ends up with me having my internet cut off for at least a day, almost monthly and that is causing very serious health issues. Never mind the fact that if I'm in the wrong environment when I have one of these emergencies, it is a very real life threat. So, I'm very sorry to say but I'm under my rights. Mhmm. Through the American with Disabilities Act.
I'm asking that y'all reconsider your position as a reasonable accommodation for my injuries and my illnesses so that I can manage my care. Remove the credit block because it's discriminatory considering I had no choice in becoming homeless. You don't get paid while you're waiting for disability. That's not a secret. That's a well known fact.
If that can't be done, then I need y'all to please document it in writing because I am keeping record of all of this at this point. And if need be, I will forward it up to the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission, and the state of Texas, along with the National Registry of EMTs, the IAFF, the NAEMT, and any law enforcement groups that I happen to be a part of too because twenty years of service and the way this has all gone the last few months, that's not something most of us would be okay with. Okay.
Speaker 5:
Well, I can definitely have a look at the account for you. So I'm noticing on two of your phones, you've got insurance. So did you lose one of your phones?
Speaker 1:
When I came over to y'all, I brought all of my own devices. I had my I have nerve damage in my hands. I've had a several calls go very badly and unfortunately have a lot of mobility issues these days. And I dropped my phone a lot. My phone got broken.
I went through quite a lengthy process to try and get it repaired because it had to go to a local place down off of Hewlett Street here in Fort Worth and they ended up not repairing it correctly. I ended up not having my phone for like three days while I waited for y'all's actual insurance company. I think it's Asurion. To send me a new device. And so I just just locked down inside for that few days because I couldn't go out without having that monitoring and that tether back to communication and to my medical team.
Yeah. Watch did get lost. I was in the process of transitioning everything over. You can see where I had signed up an account for it and I had not activated it. It was an unfortunate accident involving a trip with my kid, and my watch ended up lost.
It sucked, and I was not too burnt about it. But then when I got told, hey. You know, we're not gonna be able to replace it. And it wasn't that I was asking y'all to replace it like it was insured. I was just trying to say, hey.
I've I've already established the line. I just don't have the watch anymore. I wanna get a new one. Let's just put it on there with the rest of my shit, and that's when they said, sir, your credit, we're never gonna finance anything to you. Okay.
Then at that point, you've effectively misled me this whole time because I came over here under the pretense of upgrade anytime. Meanwhile, y'all's website is advertising a promotion right now for a year of service for free. And I'm just that's when I finally decided I needed to reach out to y'all and say, hey. This this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Mhmm.
And I don't wanna address it in a negative way. I would like to be able to come to an amicable agreement that, you know, everybody's happy with.
Speaker 5:
Of course. I mean, is it regards to the promotion, what happens is that you would have to add a new line to get the free line of service for twelve months.
Speaker 1:
Why would I add a new line when I've got three? Like Mhmm. Sir
Speaker 5:
Yeah. Yeah. I definitely understand what you're saying.
Speaker 1:
I can't replace my phone if it gets broken unless it's covered by insurance. Like, if if some freak accident happens and it breaks and it's not covered by y'all's insurance policy, I have no way to replace this device. Your organization has categorically told me because my credit is bad, I cannot do financing through y'all. And I'm saying that's discrimination because my credit went to crap because I was waiting for federal disability approval. These are not grand luxury items.
These are tools that I use to monitor my care. I don't have a problem paying for them. I do have a problem being told I'm not allowed to access them unless I pay full price because of something I had absolutely no control over. I would very much rather still be pulling my shifts and going to work every day at forty one, not sitting at home hiding every day.
Speaker 5:
Yes. I definitely understand. But what happens when we do, an order? We do do across, sorry, a soft credit check. I can definitely, try to put in an order for you and see what what happens.
Alright. Okay. So that's because I
Speaker 1:
I should make very clear to you, though, as it's been advised to me by my legal counsel Uh-huh. My credit being an issue now or in a year from now because of it being related to my disability, that we're gonna end up in this same position. That's why I asked for y'all to review the account. And if there is a block on it because of my credit due to that being a result of physical injury from service injuries, I'm asking that it be removed as a reasonable accommodation.
Speaker 5:
Okay. I mean, in regards to the soft credit check, you would need to get in contact with the credit bureau because we don't block it.
Speaker 1:
You can
Speaker 5:
put it in the order.
Speaker 1:
Are you telling me that y'all are not willing to make an accommodation as requested by a federally recognized disabled person?
Speaker 5:
Well, we wouldn't be able to override the you know, what comes up on the credit check,
Speaker 2:
we wouldn't be able to override it. I do apologize for that.
Speaker 1:
Okay. And what what's your name again and your title?
Speaker 5:
My first name is Parks, p a r k s. Yes. And I'm in the leadership team in the mobile department.
Speaker 1:
Okay. Well, you're welcome to go ahead and run my credit, but I'm telling you right now, I'm recording all of this, and it will be a part of a packet that gets turned in because, I'm sorry, telling me that I'm gonna be punished because I got injured, especially serving my community and no. I'm sorry. That's not how it works. That's why we have the Americans with Disability Act.
That's what it's for. So that we're not blocking access to systems and resources from people that need them. Isn't so I can get on Facebook or Twitter. This is so that I can monitor my vital signs so that my mind can be tracked and mapped regularly.
Speaker 5:
Yes. I understand what you're saying. I'm just advising that when we do order, it does go through a soft credit check.
Speaker 1:
Okay. Well, let's hope it works.
Speaker 5:
Okay. Is that for the iPhone 15?
Speaker 1:
No. I am trying to stay calm at the moment. No. I need a watch, the Ultra two, because it's the one with the most medical monitoring systems in it, which integrate with the health care platform that I've been leading development on for over a year now to help people in my situation. First responders and soldiers that are injured and need extra monitoring.
Speaker 5:
Yeah. Got you. Well, what I can do because it'd it'd be a new line on the account, I can get you over to our sales department, and they'll be able to help you with it.
Speaker 1:
Why are we do if I qualify for the Upgrade Anytime plan, why can't I just change my iPad to a watch?
Speaker 5:
Because you can only exchange it for a phone. We just wouldn't be able to exchange it for a watch. You'd have to add these new lines.
Speaker 1:
So I have to take on extra debt on top of this. You realize that that's a barrier that you're placing for me. Right? I wanna make sure that's clear, that you're telling me that I have to establish another line of service, which will incur another bill of cost. I don't mind paying the taxes.
I don't mind paying the monthly bill. I do mind being forced into adding an extra line when supposedly you say I should qualify for the upgrade anytime. That's that's a problem. That's manipulation also. And that's taking advantage of people that are in situations that can't afford to be forced into these situations.
I'm serious. I'm I'm talking about real life threats. There are people
Speaker 5:
We put this in our terms and conditions. I do apologize for that. But when we exchange it, it'd just be for a phone.
Speaker 1:
Tell you what. Go ahead and transfer me to sales. Let's see if I can get a watch. And if I can, I will have my attorney review this phone call and see if he feels the same way about it that I do, and we'll go from there? But in the meantime, I still need to be able to monitor my care.
I still need to be able to access the full breadth of my resources when I'm both at home and outside of my home so that I'm not a prisoner in my home. So if you would please kindly transfer me, and let's hope that the gods shine on me today.
Speaker 5:
Okay. I definitely will. Well, bear with me one moment, and I'll get you transferred straight over.
Speaker 3:
Thank you for calling Spectrum in St. Louis. My name is Ty. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?
Speaker 1:
Robert Hansen.
Speaker 3:
And how are you today, Robert?
Speaker 1:
Not that well, but that's not your fault.
Speaker 3:
Going on? Okay. Well, how can I help, Billy?
Speaker 1:
I need to see if y'all can get me set up with a Apple Watch Ultra two, please.
Speaker 3:
Okay. Alright. Do you already have an account with this?
Speaker 1:
Yes. I do. In fact, I was just talking to a member of your leadership with customer retention and informing him that their business practices regarding my account are getting dangerously close to violating my rights as outlined under the American with Disability Act. And considering I'm a disabled first responder, that's not really that great of a situation for me to be in.
Speaker 3:
Okay. Yes, sir. And I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see how I can get this taken care of for you. So first, what's a good number in case you and I get disconnected?
I can call you back.
Speaker 1:
Area code (817) 422-2693.
Speaker 3:
Okay. And, Robert, what's the address for you?
Speaker 1:
8128 Foxfire Lane, Apartment D As In Delta, White Settlement, Texas 76108.
Speaker 6:
Okay.
Speaker 3:
Alright. Let me pull everything up for
Speaker 2:
you. Alright.
Speaker 3:
Let me see here. Okay. So we are looking to add the UltraWatch two. Right? Yes.
Okay. I know you've probably already been through this process, but just to be on the safe side, do you know your four digit security code?
Speaker 1:
2415.
Speaker 3:
Perfect. Thank you so much here, Robert. Let me pull that mobile sign up for us. Okay. So when I pull the mobile side up, it does give me the error.
It says there's a recent problem with the customer's card on file. Please advise customer an updated credit card on file is required.
Speaker 1:
Because I got paid today by Social Security, and that was why I called your leadership because I wanted to give them the opportunity to fix the problems that have arisen before I give y'all the little bit of money I have. Because if this doesn't get sorted out, then aside from me going to the Department of Justice, I'm also gonna have to establish lines of service elsewhere. And, frankly, I'm not gonna turn money over to y'all when every time I have so far, y'all have turned around and said, oh, yeah. Sorry. We lied.
Speaker 3:
Okay. Alright.
Speaker 1:
He was kinda failing to catch that, though, and I understand that it's kinda hard to understand me sometimes. I get a little flustered. This is a big deal. It's my life, and I'm the one that's in danger.
Speaker 3:
No. I I completely understand everything you're saying. I you're speaking loud and clear enough for me to understand, so I I do get it. So give me a few moments. So Alright.
So the only issue that I'm running into is I can give you, like, a a price, like, a roundabout price, but it doesn't let me actually get into the mobile order without the
Speaker 1:
I'm I'm sorry, but that's why I contacted your leadership, and they felt it was necessary to turf it down to you. I personally think that was unfair. And if you feel you need to escalate it back up, by all means, I encourage you to do so.
Speaker 3:
Yeah. No. No. No. I I understand.
And so here's what I'm gonna try and do, at least give you okay. If you don't mind me asking, what happened? I know you said it was
Speaker 1:
I was contacted by Spectrum at the turn of the year. It was somewhere in that last week or so of December, first week of January. So whenever my service started, it was about two days before that. Spectrum contacted me. It was obviously one of y'all's promotional deals.
Upgrade anytime. You come over and sign up with you guys. They will give everybody a new phone. You can upgrade anytime. Bundle your Internet, your TV, and your mobile service together, and it'll be cheaper.
And I got over here, and they said, well, no. Actually, you've gotta bring your devices. And then they wanted me to trade the devices in to upgrade. And I said, no. I'm sorry, but I paid for this device out of my pocket with the money I got after finally winning my cage.
I'm sorry. No. I'm not turning it over when y'all have no right to it. And by the next time that I asked about trying to upgrade my phone, they finally just told me, I'm sorry, but your credit is horrible, and there is no way we will ever finance to you. And I said, you realize that my credit is the way it is because I lost my home waiting on disability from getting injured.
Speaker 3:
Oh, man.
Speaker 1:
And they the people at the Spectrum store here in Fort Worth quite literally said, that doesn't matter to us. But that's neither here nor there. Yeah. From my perspective, you know, I went to work one day and my whole life changed that day. And by the time it was said and done, I lost everything of mine.
My home, my vehicle, my career, my family, my friends, my colleagues, and I ended up sleeping on the streets. Don't think it's a lot to ask for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA as this is a direct result of my injuries and my medical disability as recognized by the United States federal government to say, hey. Wanna maybe ease up off of that credit thing? I obviously am very passionate about keeping my service intact because I'm going to all this hell and trouble to try and make sure that I can stay monitored as best as I can.
Speaker 3:
And Right. No.
Speaker 1:
Nobody seems to care. It's very frustrating, especially when being a medic, I know how dangerous it is if I have something like a dissociative episode where I can't communicate appropriately, and nobody will be able to tell that I'm not just some funked out, strung out guy that I'm actually having a very real medical emergency.
Speaker 3:
Right. No. I hear you. And I am so very sorry that all of this happened to you. Let me place you on a brief hold
Speaker 1:
You're fine.
Speaker 3:
See what I'm able to do on my end. I don't wanna make any guarantees, but I am gonna speak with my supervisor to see if there is anything that I could do to at least even get around the card information. So, basically, what you're wanting to know is if you're able to get the Apple
Speaker 1:
No. I'm want watch you Right? I'm wanting to establish a service. If y'all will guarantee that I am getting that watch, I'll pay my bill and for the taxes on the watch right now. I just won't do it prior to because if y'all are gonna stand on this mountain that Spectrum's decided to put their flag in, then I'm gonna have to go seek service elsewhere, and that is gonna incur considerable financial cost.
Okay.
Speaker 3:
Alright. Well, give me a few moments here, Robert. Let me see what I could do. Okay?
Speaker 1:
Alright. I appreciate it. Thank you. No problem. I'll place you brief Of
Speaker 3:
course. Of course. And, again, I am sorry that all this happened. I'm gonna do my very best to get you taken care of, but I'll place you on a brief hold, but it'll be a silent hold. That way, you don't have to take your time.
Okay? Thank you. Alright. You're welcome. Alright, Robert.
I know that hold could get a little scary here with you being silent, but I am still here. Give me just a few more moments. Okay?
Speaker 1:
You're fine.
Speaker 3:
Alright. Thank you.
Speaker 2:
Sure.
Speaker 3:
Alright. Give me just a few moments. I'm gonna reach out to this escalations team, try not to get you transferred here. I wanna try and work on everything on my own. Okay?
Speaker 2:
Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 3:
Just a few moment. You're welcome.

Speaker 3:
Alright, Robert. So spoke with the other department, and so the issue that I'm having is that I can't see if you're eligible to finance without being able to get into the mobile side without being able to get into the mobile side or in order for me to get into the mobile side, that bill has to be paid. So here's what I am going to do. I am bear with me. Give me one second.
Bear with me. Okay. Give me just a few moments here. Okay? I'm I'm doing my best.
Speaker 1:
You're fine. Ma'am, I Okay. Seriously, when I say I'm willing to work with y'all, I really am. I'm not Yeah. Y'all trying to be unreasonable.
I'm just trying to look out for my own well-being and advocate for myself.
Speaker 3:
Of course. I I understand. So, yeah, I was looking here. We gotta be able to get into the financial side to see.
Speaker 1:
And that's why I asked for the member of leadership to please do the right thing so that I don't have to get off of the phone and contact the government. Because make no mistake about it. I am not making a threat to your organization. I'm informing y'all of an inevitability. I don't make threats.
Threats are a waste of energy and time, and they show that you have no integrity because you won't stand behind what you claim you will do. I'm telling you. Yeah. I have enough well certainty about my condition and the circumstances around this situation that when I contact the government, it's going to become an issue. It's not going to go away overnight, and I'm going to make sure that every first responder in the nation knows about it because I'm one of them.
And I got hurt as one of them.
Speaker 3:
Right. No. I hear you, and I understand. So here's what I'm gonna do because on my end, it's not allowing me to go anywhere.
Speaker 5:
No.
Speaker 3:
So I have to get you over and escalate this to mobile billing.
Speaker 1:
That's fine.
Speaker 3:
Okay? Give me just a few minutes here. I'll get you transferred. Okay?
Speaker 1:
Okay. You're fine.
Speaker 3:
Alright. Okay.

Speaker 6:
Hi. Thank you for calling Spectrum Mobile. I'm Hannah, specialist in Upstate New York. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
Speaker 1:
Hi, Hannah. My name is Robert Hanson, and I am a disabled first responder from Texas. How are you?
Speaker 6:
Good. How are you? Thank you for asking.
Speaker 1:
Oh, I've had better days.
Speaker 6:
Yeah. What's going on?
Speaker 1:
Okay. I will ask that you bear with me because this is a pretty pretty lengthy little ordeal to get through here.
Speaker 6:
Yeah.
Speaker 1:
I came to y'all somewhere at the turn of the year. December, somewhere right in that area. Had a lot going on. I don't remember the exact date. But when I came over, it was because y'all had reached out and contacted me.
And I understand that it was a promotion, but it was that promotion that caused me to break service with another organization where I was happy and come here because I felt the offer was a better deal. The offer being if I came over, brought my lines of service, all that, Internet, everything, it would all be bundled together. It would be cheaper, and I would be able to upgrade anytime I like, which it actually says on my, profile on my account that I'm eligible to upgrade anytime I want, which is part of our problem. When I first got to y'all, I was told, no. You have to bring your own device with you, and then in a couple of months, we'll upgrade you.
And I was like, alright. I'll go with that. And during that time, ended up the Apple Watch that I was in the process of establishing service with y'all for because I was bringing it from another provider, ended up getting lost. And when I tried to just say, hey. You know, I don't have it anymore.
Let me go ahead and just let's set it up as a whole new line. Get me a watch. I use this for monitoring my care. It monitors my heart rate, tracks my moods and emotions, my sleep patterns, all very fundamental important things relating to my medical disabilities. They ended up telling me that I was not able to, that I didn't qualify based on my credit.
I said, are you telling me that y'all are refusing to do any of what y'all promised, basically, because I have crappy credit. That's basically what it's coming down to. And the person at the Spectrum store over at Camp Bowie in Fort Worth said, yeah. That's pretty much exactly what I'm telling you. Sorry.
I said, well, that's that's really shitty because, see, my credit is shit because when I got injured and I couldn't work anymore, I lost my home. I ended up homeless. I lost all of my productions. I lost my car. My kid lost her stuff, my diplomas, my books, shit that I had had since I was a child and held on to.
Of mine, my grandmother's, all of it, gone. I lost my family in the process. I lost my entire life because one day I went to work, and I just never came home. So telling me that I'm now being punished because of that, I understand that my credit is crappy. Believe me, I get it.
I'm the one that has to deal with it daily, but there's nothing I can do about that. And punishing me for it is not okay. We have laws against that. And that's why I contacted y'all earlier today and asked to speak to a member of leadership, got somebody on the phone, and I explained to them that under title three, the Americans with Disabilities Act, that I'm being discriminated against for my disability, and that I'm not receiving the right to enjoy the same services and goods that everybody else has an opportunity to enjoy. Except for me, these aren't services and goods.
These are lifelines. They go to my doctors. They go to my care team. They go to my emergency contacts. If I stop tracking for a certain amount of time, it starts alerting people.
Pretty sophisticated system I've built, actually, which is why it's got seven pending patents and probably gonna end up on every ambulance in the world in the next couple of years. So my point is I need to figure this out because being told, hey. You're getting punished, and you can't replace a line or get an upgrade or anything because your credit sucks when that was very much beyond anybody's control other than, say, maybe Washington DC. But let's face it. They're definitely not on the caring list.
I it it's just not gonna work. We can find some way to work this out. And I'm not even saying, hey. Give it to me for free. I'm saying, hey.
Just give me the opportunity to do what everybody else does.
Speaker 6:
Yeah. Most definitely. And I can completely understand your frustration here. When you called earlier and talked to a member of leadership, what did they tell you?
Speaker 1:
They told me that they would have to transfer me to sales. Sales could run a soft credit check, and we would see what happened. And I said, sir, I'm gonna advise against that because if they deny me, this whole packet, our conversation right now, yours, and my conversation right now, the records from all the other conversations, all of it gets forwarded to the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission and down to Austin to the state of Texas.
Speaker 2:
Twenty four hours to look for an email from.
Speaker 6:
Yeah. Of course. Definitely. I can definitely understand your frustration with the entire situation, sir. I I do know that with the Anytime Upgrade, it does run a soft credit check through Experian.
That does limit a customer's finance through the custom through the company's
Speaker 1:
bled over here under deceptive practices, in which case my argument remains the same and as valid. Therefore, it will still go to the department of justice because you're deliberately discriminating against somebody who told you openly from day one Yes. What my credit was, what my finances were, what my life was. I never hid it. I was open about it.
I talked to the people signing me up about that stuff. So I understand. You can say it's a part of your promotion, but it inherently discriminates against me because there's nothing I could have done to prevent what happened. Therefore, I'm being blocked from the same opportunity that most other people just naturally get to have that. I not gotten injured, I would still get to have along with a job, a car, a home.
Speaker 6:
That that's just not true, sir. I mean, whatever the personal reason is that a customer's credit may be low, that does affect their finance with the company?
Speaker 1:
I'm gonna tell you right now as a health care provider of over twenty years, these are not luxury items. They are used for monitoring medical conditions and injuries. And I understand that you're saying, hey. We run everybody on credit. I am exercising my rights under the ADA to say please make a reasonable accommodation due to the ADA.
And if y'all are refusing, then please, by all means, document it and send it to me in writing. I'll give you my address. I'll give you my email address.
Speaker 6:
So our mobile is paperless, so we're not sending you any physical statement, sir.
Speaker 1:
Are you refusing to acknowledge that y'all are not willing to make a reasonable accommodation? If you are, please state your name and your job title for the recording.
Speaker 6:
Sir, my name is Hannah, and I'm a mobile billing representative in Upstate New York. And what you're referring to me, the information is very subjective. I have explained our business rules to you once. You have spoken to members of leadership who have extensively explained our business rules to you. I am not too sure what you want me to do to progress this call further with you.
Speaker 1:
I've actually said very clearly, I simply want to be able to get a watch again since I was not able to because y'all have an I get it. Listen. I'm not trying to be a hard ass with y'all. I'm willing I'm not asking for y'all to do anything for free. Y'all have a promotion up on your website right now giving people a year of service for free.
Meanwhile, I got brought over here under a promotion that I don't qualify for, apparently. I'm sorry, but you're right. I'm sure it is subjective, and that's why the government has the courts and the Department of Justice. And if that's how it's gonna be, then I'm sorry. And I hate that we're gonna have to part ways that way, but I will make sure that I document it accordingly.
Speaker 6:
Most definitely, sir. And I'm just a mobile billing representative. That's your free will. Whatever you decide to do after this call is definitely your, you know, personal information.
Speaker 1:
Not surprised you transfer me back to leadership, and I thought that's who you were.
Speaker 6:
Sir, I'm, again, I'm just a mobile billing representative. Is there anything you would like me to do to progress this call further? You mentioned getting a watch. If you wanted to go down that road, you would have to talk to a sales specialist. You'd be able to get a watch through us, just not finance one because it does depend on a customer's credit.
Well, that's a personal reason that a customer's credit may be low. It does run a soft credit check, and that affects the financing with Spectrum. Okay.
Speaker 1:
Well, unfortunately, I think we're at an impasse because y'all aren't going to work with me, apparently. I'm not asking for anything unreasonable, so I guess I will have to escalate this myself. I'm sorry. I hope that you have a good day, and you have a good week.
Speaker 6:
Too, sir. You too, sir.
Speaker 1:
Bye bye.
Speaker 6:
Bye bye now.
