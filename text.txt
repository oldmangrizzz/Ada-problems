You
Well, let me go ahead and just briefly start at the very beginning and I asked that you bear with me for a moment. Maybe we can come to some sort of resolution over this whole deal before it gets any worse. 

Participant
OK 

You
Right about the first of the year might've been in the last couple of weeks of December might've been the first week or two of January. I don't remember exactly when I got a promotional for y'all. I've been inviting me to bring my service beer company and I would have Internet phone for myself a watch for myself on. Phone for my father who I carry his service. I also carry a watch for him. All of us are currently active on your network at this moment except for my watch because in the process of transitioning, my daughter who got a hold of my watch one day and she lost it of course Wanna get upset and yell at them but you can't oh she did not know, though when that happens that that watch is how I'm monitor a lot of my medical issues. I have a traumatic brain injury and a bunch of other medical problems associated with my career as the first responder here in the North Texas region and I use those devices my phone and my Internet connection at home and the watch that I used to have. To not just monitor my vinyl signs, but maintain contact with my healthcare team and with family when needed in case of an emergency very serious issues that if they're not handled in a very particular way, it's not the type of stuff you can just go to the emergency room for it very important not lifestyle luxuries it's not TikTok in YouTube this is Real time monitoring 24 seven I attempted to explain the situation when my daughter lost my watch and said hey I know we were in the process transitioning it and I was bringing mine. My kid lost it. I'm sorry about that. We've already got the line established let me just go ahead and get a new watch. I'll pay the down payment for it which is typically what the tax for whatever the device is on. And will be good to go and go from there, and they advised me that that would not be possible, even though my promotional had been for upgrade any time that they weren't really sure why couldn't really tell me why, but for some reason the system was denying me and that I probably just needed to wait a day or two so a couple days later I went in and Same person and I'm back how are you and we talk and try it again and no go again they said well maybe it'll take a month or two so I'm waiting a little while in that time because I've nerve damage in my hands. Also, I've dropped my phone a lot and in the process damaged my phone. This is the phone that I brought from another provider but Y'all were carrying insurance on home due to mine not being eligible for upgrade. When I joined your service. I had tried to get it repaired. They sent me to a local shop. The guys were actually very nice. They just did not complete the ceiling of the screen and about five days after I had gotten it repaired. It quit working and I was without a device for I think it was about 72 hours in total, which was honestly quite terrifying and I couldn't leave my home because of it but your insurance company did get me a replacement device sent out and they were pretty good about it once I got the situation explained they were good Since then, I have not been able for any reason to upgrade my device to reestablish having a connected, watch anything, despite all efforts and on top of that a couple of weeks ago, I knew that my home Internet bill was coming past due I simply could not afford it. I get $2000 a month to survive on and I've already told you I'm raising a teenager 41. I'm not I just got injured doing my career.

I reached out to your call center spoke to him and they had not been able to extend a long gray. But they were understanding when I explain that it was for medical needs and that I have monitoring equipment in the home they got me reconnected I could not even reached the day that I had agreed to pay them on yet and they suspended my service again. I had to borrow money for my ex-wife to get my service. Turned back on at home fence then I have reached out to your customer care team two separate times. Both of which I have logs and transcripts of all And tried to communicate with them to find out what is the disconnect here because I understand That y'all don't want to upgrade a device or do whatever because I have bad credit. I understand that however my credit is what it is because I got injured on the job as a first responder and I spent 3 3 months. Going through the disability application process to get fully found it found a fully favorable for Social Security disability. I ended up homeless in that process. I lost my car. I lost my home. My daughter lost all her possessions. I lost all mine my family jail loan everything I had ever owned, it was gone. Along with my career So to say that it's upsetting that my credit problems are being thrown in my face when they are the result of injuries I received serving is a huge insult but when I try to explain that and say, I'm sorry under the American with disabilities act title three There are reasonable accommodations that can be requested. I have tried desperately to work with y'all at every turn. I called the other day and explain to an agent that I get the credit thing. However, y'all are running a promotion right now for a three year service for new customers I've just joined a couple of months ago. If y'all are not dedicated to your credit is an issue. OK then I ask respectfully that you transition me over to this more recent promo. And at least that will give me an opportunity to not have this sitting on top of my head and I can try and get my life back in order and readjusted all continue on his friends and happy business associates 

Participant
OK, I'm so sorry to hear about everything that you've been through. That sounds like an absolutely brutal time so I'm happy to take a look at you know what we can do for you Robert I just need to get into the account a little bit. 

You
OK 

Participant
So I've been I have been also taking notes as you've been kind of filling me in on everything but I wanna make sure 

You
Oh absolutely 

Participant
it's right. I wanna make sure I got the right account here. Can you verify the service address on it for me? 

You
Yeah 8128 Fox Fire Ln. apartment D as in Delta White Sutherland, TX 76108 

Participant
Thank you and do you happen to know the four digit security code? 

You
2 415 

Participant
Thank you All right, let's get in here and take a look I'm just taking a look at what we have you on in 

You
Oh, you're fine if you hear any 

Participant
terms of 

You
talking in the background, pick my kiddo up from the orthodontist 

Participant
That's completely fine. You do what you've gotta do. Looks like we've got you on a total of 8 4 cable and Internet And then Three unlimited plus line All right so I do see where you had given us a call back on March 31 so about three days ago trying to get An upgrade done and it 

You
I had 

Participant
looks like 

You
actually called the day before that and I have a log of it. I'm trying to do the pre- service after I had spoken to somebody that was supposedly with your compliance team who transferred me to a regular sales agent the sales agent completely ignored everything I said, and tried to explain to me how an Apple Watch works and that he wanted to offer me one for free. But that had to pay the taxes on it and I said well then that's not free and you've never actually answered my question and that was when the conversation kind of broke down and I said I'll tell you what I will try reaching out to you tomorrow and that was the next day that I talked 

Participant
OK So what I'm showing is that your due date for your mobile bill is the 21st of the month and 

You
That's correct. I 

Participant
so 

You
advised them at the time of those previous communication that I don't get paid by Social Security until the 2 7th through the third. I don't wanna control over that and then having mine auto pay date on that day was always going to result in the same situation can I get a bacon cheeseburger just make cheese and bacon only And a Coke I'm sorry 

Participant
So the reason 

You
I'm sorry I'm sorry OK OK, thank you Honey, get whatever you want Sorry about that I was trying to order lunch on Yes, when I spoke to y'all the other day and the guy had offered to let me get a watch. I let them know that time also that I get paid by law according to Social Security somewhere between the 27th and the third of every month they have in until midnight on the third of every month have that transaction posted to my account I don't ever know in 

Participant
Right 

You
advance when it's gonna come in. I didn't get a 

Participant
And I can definitely 

You
choice. I did not get a choice over when that payment was 

Participant
understand 

You
on payment date was put I've not been able to alter it and I'm sorry but again I've already told you I get $2000 a month to survive on. I've got medical conditions that requires constant monitoring care and I'm still raising a teenager in height. That makes it very hard to stretch that I'm not asking for a handout from anybody but a little lenient seeing Grace were appropriate. Absolutely they have more than earned it. 

Participant
The reason that I point that out is because When there is a payment that needs to be made on the account our systems actually block us from being able to place an order for a new device 

You
I'm sorry 

Participant
So it's very possible that the soft credit check was actually not the issue and that we were unable to process the order because of this past due payment 

You
Ma'am, I have had this exact same credit issue with y'all multiple other times as I have told you previously, and as I have told other representatives, there is no reason to indicate that that is the case this time, however Under title three of the American with disabilities act, I do have the right to ask for reasonable accommodation modification to your policy regarding the credit check. I've asked multiple times I've asked that it be documented multiple times and I've asked that they refusal be documented multiple times and that has been denied every single time which is why now today I have all right to think this is a Tory issue because made any effort to even listen to me explaining the situation. This could've been avoided and the build would've already been paying, but I'm not gonna give you the last of my money when you're refusing to even listen to me advocate for my rights. One of your representatives told me that that was a subjective point of view. I'm sorry respectfully the law does disagree with y'all and that's why I've got a brief that I am preparing regarding this whole matter I want to work with y'all. I just wanna go on and live my life. I don't want anything, but y'all refused. I'm reaching out today just because I was driving my daughter to the orthodontist and my phone signal just terminated immediately knew my line was suspended. This is my final attempt to. We gotta work something out otherwise I'm sorry, but this is going up the chain and it's not stomping at the DOJ. It's going to the FCC it's going to the state of Texas. It's going to national the national Association of EMT international Association of firefighters along with every military unit I've ever been associated with because I have repeatedly just asked. For a little not for Anything extravagant I haven't asked for y'all to give me anything. The only reason I brought up the free of service is because y'all are running that as a promotion right now and deny the promotion that I was brought over due to my credit, which is a direct result of my injuries That's discrimination that's not subject 

Participant
I hear where you're coming from the credit check is done by Experian so all we all we are able to do is put in the 

You
Ma'am 

Participant
information and they give us a result so 

You
Find out because this whole call has been recorded and documented and it's going into the legal no 

Participant
Of course it is all of our calls are recorded 

You
I mean, I'm recording it and I'm putting it into the legal brief and I'm going to send it off today because I'm done. I'm at my limit. I don't think you'll 

Participant
That's fine OK 

You
understand their lives at state you're not just mine. There are other people in situations like mine and if y'all are treating me like this while I'm advocating for myself, I can't imagine how y'all are treating people who don't know how to. And that is actually what I am the most upset about. I'm sorry I spent a career watching that stuff on. I will not spend my retirement living once so I apologize for picking up a large amount of your time Hoping we could reach one more attempt at working something out, but I hope you have a wonderful day 

Participant
I hope you do as well bye 

You
Bye
