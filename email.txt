Hi Robert,
 
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Erika, and I’m reaching out from T-Mobile’s Executive Office. I tried giving you a call earlier today but wasn’t able to connect, so I wanted to follow up with you via email.  First and foremost, I want to sincerely apologize for the experience you had at our store. We truly value you as a customer, and I’m sorry that your visit didn’t reflect the level of service we strive to provide.
 
As we discussed on Friday, August 1, 2025, I’ve applied a total credit of $176.00 to your account, which consisted of the $70.00 to cover the restocking fee and $106.00 toward your first month’s bill. This credit updated your account with a credit balance of $70.94.
 
Regarding your request to help remove the deposit for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, I understand this is an important device for you, and I appreciate you sharing the medical necessity behind it. While T-Mobile is not legally required under the ADA or other laws to provide financial exceptions based on disability-related financial hardship, I want to do what I can to support you.  As a one-time goodwill gesture, I’d be happy to apply an additional $145.00 credit toward your account. If you’d like me to proceed with this, just reply to this email and I’ll take care of it right away.
