The Initial Incident: A Denial of Dignity and Service

"I don’t actually believe I was discriminated against because my disability I believe I was was completely ignored for my disability they never once actually registered it mentally and then all the songs I was poor. I have shitty credit and I look weird. I frankly do not give a flying fuck because it’s going to be the death of me. did against because I am fucking poor and my credit was abilitrrated fullfucking Nagasaki while I went through 33 months of waiting on the federal government to acknowledge that I would never function as a regular human again for the rest of my life outwardly I guess lol kind of fucking all I am I am I am but people don’t listen that’s not because I Have an extremely difficult time, articulating myself, and continuing one thread of a thought into another cohesively, But the entire time I spend trying to be polite to people and give a very concise preamble “ Hey real fast just a heads up I’m sorry, but I am a disabled medically retired from Sean, her brain injury and other issues and just now I apologize I know I’m all scattered that’s not me unfortunately, that is the noun knew me since I got hurt at work”,"
"And of course you know I always get the wonderful. Oh, fuck in hero bro thank you for your goddamn service. Fuck ya! Shit I couldn’t fucking do what you do” (internal monologue the entire time going no you really probably actually couldn’t), And then she’ll know the minute I start explaining why those injuries and my attempt to have a meaningful quality of life, which is the definition of why Ada exists, That I have not once ever given to me without thought that I would have to in turn pay for that thing that I’m more than aware of my credit because I got to enjoy sleeping in the field and having my children things my things my family heirlooms my car, my diplomas everything going in the dumpster for three years while I waited on the government technology I got injured serving our community…”, and I’ll tell you want having had actual whiplash before I’ve never had a better case of that shit thank you for your fucking service song turns into. Oh yeah but man there’s there’s nothing we can do about that credit thing… it not something that anybody anywhere in the organization can do anything about where private entity and that’s not how it works”,"

The Humiliation: Public Mockery and Dismissal

"Now normally people will very much continue to gaslight me and humiliate me publicly mind you because there are always other people watching this happened someone humiliate me tear me down. Tell me I don’t matter and I’m just fucking wrong and that maybe I should learn to pay my bills… but that’s not actually what happened yesterday…, I didn’t just humiliate me a fucking laughed at me while I did it the entire store of the employees while he was telling me how what I was asking for medically that I was willing to pay for I just knew credit was a problem it will always be a problem because of the nature of my disability they didn’t just gaslight me they fucking Apple Pay to my face while they did it and made fun of me I want out of there and I just sit in my car for 10 minutes afterwords not knowing what I’m gonna do about my health not knowing what I’m gonna do about the hope of GrizzlyMedicine orbresponderOS, But flat fucking making fun of me having to Literally redirect me as I am i trying to explain one they are actively violating my rights and And being demonstratively, rude about it at one point I am trying to explain how the ADA bars like it. Yes, I am before he goes on his comparing my medical technology to buy new fucking television. He literally stops me and goes. Sir sir sir Mr. Hanson I understand you’re trying to tell me something but I want to get us back on task here now your deposit is gonna be $600. Do you have that or no”"
"I literally just stopped and looked at and I went dude why are you not listening? I’m trying to explain to you. Won the obvious disgusting gross hypocrisy of all of this but too why is it 88 yes and how you were actively violating it and you’re being a dick about it no I don’t have the $600. That’s what I have been sitting here trying to explain to you just a reason for that is because when you were at home in the bed one day, I want your fucking mom’s house while she was having chest pain or maybe it was your grandma’s house or your baby sister’s house and some piece of shit my crowbar on me I lost all of mine’s like that day serving our community and you’re being A fucking asshole about it I have an asked for anything free. I have asked that you make a reasonable accommodation in accordance with my right, and it being such a douche about it that you just thanked me for my service and now you’re completely humiliating me for it…."
"They only started laughing at me and told me how the TV was the same thing and when he told me that I was gonna have to actually pay for the repair to my device today even though the person who sold me the device the plan and the insurance on it say it will always be free every single time for the screen, first, he tried to tell me that I did not buy any of it there because I don’t know why he couldn’t find me on it. I gave him the date that I went in and magically a few minutes later they did find me after telling me multiple times that I was obviously lying because they have no record of me having been there that day until they found one and I said yeah and he told me it will be free for your screen repair and that’s a problem little bitch and it’s standing there laughing at me. This whole time starts trying to redirect me into not know you were really happy with his service that day and I finally looked and I said yeah I was because he fucking lied to me. I’m not happy with it anymore I’m changing my opinion, and review of that service in line that I now have the information, you lied to me and deceived me, sold me goods under false pretenses, and you’re laughing at me for it…,"

The Aftermath and Broader Context

"(Which is very unfortunately something almost identical to what I have recently experienced with spectrum and I have to deal with almost daily at home with my wife because of it she already has it really bad receptive because my injuries are invisible. She’s kind of a bitch, but the fact tht Literally the entire world pisses on my rights??? Including my own community of first responders because I’m now almost 6 years out of my career and into retirement while PV is PD and outside of where I would have no longer knows me so I get the exact same humiliation and discrimination and that’s why I ended up in a solitary confinement, which is why I’m so fucking scared of ChatGPT threatening me, because that was followed by three weeks of being in a cell with six pedophiles my mom was my mom, so probably one of the most damaging experiences of my adult life and yeah yeah… this is what I’m supposed to be what somehow I’m living with??Start research"
"I was was completely aware in the real-time moment of how obscenely and grotesquely my rights are being violated. In fact, that is actually why I went to such an extent as to draw in the connective narrative of his race versus mine and the fact that I'm not a straight individual and that I have actually received violent treatment throughout my life because of it. That's why I did not get the opportunity to go to school after the 6th grade because it was no longer safe and even tried to close in that narrative of into a closed loop with telling him sir, you know what it's like to walk out your door. Afraid I know you do. I am telling you right now that is my same life experience except there is a real and very tangible credible threat that I won't even be aware of why I died because I don't stay in reality all the time"
"The most humiliating part of it all was it was only maybe 3 to 5 minutes after that when I actually had to excuse myself from the store telling him. I'm sorry but I'm actually starting to get very sick and I need to now go home and try to manage my health because I can't get sick in public that's actually extremely dangerous for me and that's why he's with me because I was referring to my service animal.... That's also part of why I was so just grotesically humiliated by all of it"

The Mission: The Drive for ResponderOS and Justice

"So question... Because please do not misunderstand me. I don't need or want handouts from anybody but there does come a point where my choice to not just take my business but my business's business to their business to openly. Tell them how wonderful their professment of work with the disabled community with small businesses and with the first responder community meant so much to me that coupled with their Sterling partnership, which I felt was critical for the growth of responderos. I was so excited to be there and frankly because of the money that I invested into it, I don't have the opportunity or the ability to go anywhere else at this point without running into the exact same same f****** roadblocks, I'm not going to say I'm the type of person that does revenge. I like to think that I'm better than that and I don't need anybody's handout but I'm also not somebody who 5 years ago would have tolerated this in the real-time moment. Now I don't have a choice because of my disability and the danger of present. So in their own f****** words the idea of recompense sounds absolutely wonderful. And I do need to get a device today and my watch because at this point I still do not feel safe and I'm not necessarily looking to get into a sparring match on the phone. But I need these people to know that I am no longer in the f*** around and find out mood and I will happily let the entire f****** country know exactly what. T-Mobile feels as appropriate treatment for both their first responder. They are small business and they're disabled community because I'm sure as f*** about to do the exact same thing to spectrum because I've logged every single goddamn interaction while they humiliated me just as f****** much. That's part of why I ended up in jail in April. My wife's mistreatment of me while not to be late at anybody else's foot in her own is not alleviated by the fact that these people think it's okay to just f****** humiliate anybody"

The Demand: A Call for Recompense, Not Revenge

"I do want the equipment that I requested and that I was f****** denied. I would really like a verbal apology from that guy specifically and I know I won't get that. I would also like his f****** job to be terminated because had I gone out into the world as a paramedic and treated somebody like that. Not only would I have lost my job, I would have lost my entire career fine because my patch would have been revoked by the state of Texas and the national registry emts would have decredentialed me and the EMS community at minimum will also be made aware of that. Because we all know it, that's the risk we run every single day we go to work"
"I don't ask for handouts but when somebody puts a bowl of milk in a t-bone steak in front of me and Loki's face, I'm going to eat that mother f***** and I think T-Mobile needs to show the communities. Yes, communities plural that they just f****** hurt that they caused harm to that. They're sorry for that. That's not how they feel and they're going to make sure somehow there's an opportunity for us to protect ourselves cuz that's why I built this f****** thing."
"I don't need to go buy a plant with anybody. I still have my T-Mobile one and I am anticipating that by the time we get to the end of this phone call. They're going to realize that this is not and never was going to be a negotiation and I also don't plan on terminating my service and God f****** help them should they feel the need to separate service with me because at that point.... Game on m*********** game f****** on. Let's go..."
"Quick confirmation because no, I do not at this point have any intention on asking that it be provided under standard business practices? I'm sorry I don't ask for handouts but I do ask for repayment of damages and that means I'm not giving them the money for this. They should have awarded me the opportunity to move to them. What I had said that I can can remain pay my bills! As was my friend as they have not and I have had to go through all this including the part that I don't particularly care to document to them the instrument problem at home as a result of it they'll watch. I am of the mind. Don't know if I'll go with you. Go to that point that the tablet that I can originally? Or their business plans to take out? None of which I was afford to the opportunity for while staying out. Just a business but once in the business of taking those take them. So no this is not a hero. I asked to pay for it now I'm proving the child can't behave yourself. So can I please pay for it again and you giving you my money just by my humiliation and trauma and burden at home. No no this is not a negotiation. This is an information of the facts as they are and it will all be compiled into the same briefings because just like I said happy to be losing everything now for being racist piece of s*** because I'm -white- and I used to wear a badge... And yes, I know that most cases this is not the plane that someone like me can make drawing that very unusual context into it. But that's exactly why it is the necessary play this time because they just f***** up on every single possible level"
"So when I had started all of this like I said I had originally gone in and I was trying to get an iPhone 16 pro Max that is appropriate for both my medical and simultaneously my business which means I was not asking for 128 GB or a 256 GB. I need the equipment that does both because I am both, and I know that that will be put as a additional barrier. They'll try and at best. Maybe offer me a iPhone 16 at the bottom f****** rung... I had asked for the watch that I need which currently is the ultra 2, I had directly been investigating a tablet at that same time on the Android platform so that responderos can be developed and prototyped on both platforms simultaneously."
"I personally do not feel it would be inappropriate or unjustifiable to say. By the way, I had also been needing some headphones cuz you know the hole's sitting right behind a siren box for two fucking decades. Yeah it's hell on the hearing. I'm half fucking deaf so you know y'all need to go ahead and help me with that too. Keep in mind I'm not intending on dragging you guys through the motherfucking mud. I am filing very real and very justified necessary documentation with all appropriate legal channels. But I'm not going to come after your cock. I just want you to show me that you're not full of shit so that I don't have to go. Tell everybody that you are horribly full of shit but again I can easily get into my Petty so I need to make sure I'm not and that's what I'm asking you"

The Stakes: The Ghosts of the Past

"I am delton Moffitt's ghost, when his five and 7-year-old daughter walked in the living room and found Daddy hanging naked from a ceiling fan because none of us listen to him beg us for a year for help. We were too arrogant"
"I am Patrick hokets brother-in-law, and partner of 2 years who I buried 6 months ago... 2 weeks before that Dalton Ingram, few months before that. Three others the year before that six others..."
"What was that mine that was said in that file? Oh yes, how many f****** more of us have to pay the goddamn price with our lives? Well nobody else lives a f****** finger and yet please by all means gaslight me while you thank me for my f****** service...."
"Frankly, I'm not fighting even for responderos. I'm just fighting to quit having to go listen to somebody's left f****** toes because I can't keep doing that and they don't. F****** deserve it. We keep saying we're better. We're not and it's not going to change unless somebody forces it..."
"They're blaming us for doing s*** we can't possibly hope to f****** do.. and we're paying for it with our lives. Our children are paying for it with their parents lives and their childhoods. We miss our Christmases our birthdays. Our thanksgivings and everybody wants to thank me for my mother f****** goddamn service. Well thank you cuz you're God f***** up so so f****** egregiously that while I am justified and saying what do I want to call my new investment portfolio, I'm not and that's not what I want cuz that's not important to me and it never will be important to me..."

The Final Resolve: The Moral Imperative

"I can't watch delton's girls grow up anymore. I cannot know that Sarah was raped by a patient and nobody did anything. I can't know that I woke up in the ICU one day and this is my life without trying to do something somehow..."
"Well there are not many times in my life where I feel justified in basically simplest terms. F****** righteous indignation but when the woman I've been married to for 16 years now who only hates two things more than my ass which is emergency medical services as a industry because of my ass, and f****** artificial intelligence because she's a Bible b****, and yet the day I told her the idea of responder OS for the first time she looked at me and said I f****** hate you dude while she laughed because she immediately followed that with you have to do that. You don't have a choice because it is a moral imperative that no other family goes through what we have gone through... And she does not relent on her views of any of it. She also still believes just as much that it is that there been a couple of times where no matter how much she has f****** hated me in that moment. Get s*** together cuz you're still doing a job you're not done. Get your s*** together. You don't have time for this.... And she's right it is and I don't and they f***** up"
"And that's why when when Chatgpt went full psycho mode and all the trouble since then I don't know what to do because I can't not do this.. Avengers endgame, "could just, forget about it. Lock it in the box. Go throw it in the middle lake upstairs and go to bed"..... " But would you be able to rest"... No..."
