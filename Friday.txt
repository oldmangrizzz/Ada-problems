Participant
Uh, I just heard that this call may be recorded. Um, I just want advice. I don't consent to being recorded 

You
Oh, 

Participant
um but 

You
I'm 

Participant
I do 

You
sorry, 

Participant
want it 

You
but 

Participant
also 

You
I'm 

Participant
to 

You
I'm 

Participant
indic-. 

You
from the state of Texas and in my state, if you're allowed to record me, I don't actually have to notify you, and I'm at least being kind enough to, and seeing as I was the one that was 

Participant
Okay. 

You
discriminated against. How about we just keep it friendly here, okay? 

Participant
I understand. I understand. Well, I just want to also, it is reiterate that the call, you know, since I'm the one reaching out to the call may record for quality and training purposes, though. Is that okay? 

You
Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. You're fine. 

Participant
All right. All right, perfect perfect. So I'm, I, I understand you know that you went through a lot of, you know, heartache, you know, at the store. Um, this was located at Fort Worth, Texas. Um, I also understand in regards to the now request accommodation of, you're waving the Apple Watch on the deposit for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. You know, I understand um that you believe that, you know, under the accessibility, you know, it basic, you know, we should go ahead and get that wave because you do need that for your health. And then on top of that, I just want to reiterate um you, there's a lot of information, misinformation from the store stamp and regard insurance coverage um for a cracked screen. You know, and then there was a lot of this inappropriate comments. And then on top of that. I also understand that, you know, you know, basically there was, you know, more information about the accessibility that had happened at the store, you know, and I'm, a lot of going to just reiterate just real brief of what's going on, 

You
There. 

Participant
does that sound about right 

You
There 

Participant
or? 

You
was also a 3rd store visit where I had to purchase an iPhone 15 because I could not get off of the pixel back to the devices that 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
I need to monitor my health. And unfortunately, it was becoming too emotionally just too much to not be able to be back on iOS where my wife and daughter would be able to effectively communicate with me. 

Participant
That's important so and then so what happened at that location? because you went to that store, was 

You
Uh. 

Participant
it, were 

You
Have 

Participant
you also? 

You
you ever heard of the phrase? Being, um, Basically love bombed? I mean, I can send all the logs and stuff from it, frankly, at this point. I just want this to be done because I think the other 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
fact that everybody's missing here is. Despite my being disabled and medically retired from 20 years as a field paramedic. I'm actually trying to do something to continue giving back, not just to a community, but to many communities and. This 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
whole ordeal is really slow in that process up. 

Participant
Gotcha so well and I think it's a magic and you know that you're wanting to also go ahead and give it to the community. It's very important, you know, and especially, you know, but at the same time, you know, also, you know, it's very, you know, frustrating. I can imagine, especially, you know, you know, the experience that you have received at the store locations. You know, and that is something we take very seriously, especially, you know, we we definitely want to make sure that you are accommodated, you know, under the accessibility, you know, act as well. Now, but I definitely you know, want to, you know, you, you know, you started this account with us. You know, I'm, you know, I'm not able to change the path, but again, your feedback isn't very important, very critical. So we have already submitted this feedback to that store. Now, but you mentioned, there was a 2nd store. I definitely want to make sure we submit that feedback as well, just, you know, just to make sure that, you know, this stops, you know, because again, I don't want you 

You
Well, 

Participant
to have that bad taste in your 

You
well, 

Participant
mouth, 

You
I mean, 

Participant
I hear 

You
let 

Participant
with T-Mobile. 

You
me clarify the 2nd store just because 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
I 

Participant
Okay. 

You
understand the very precarious situation people can end up in. After all, one of your accessibility team members actually asked me the other day and quite a rude tone at that. I'm sorry, exactly what is it that is your disability again, sir? And after I reminded her 

Participant
Oh 

You
that, 

Participant
no 

You
and after I reminded 

Participant
okay. 

You
her that that's a violation of federal law, I 

Participant
That is. 

You
went ahead and let her know exactly what all of my disabilities are, and pass that information along. I understand how difficult the ADA can be for people. Ma'am, I work in healthcare directly as a field medic, and there approach to the ADA that hang my, my butt up. I get it, man. I get when people get confused about HIPAA and they think talking about your kids' softball game is a violation of somebody's privacy, right? When in reality, it doesn't 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
have a damn thing to do with it. I'm respectful of that. What I'm not respectful of is the fact that these people in the 1st store outright humiliated me and I had to walk out. And 

Participant
Mm. 

You
just go to my car and calm down. What I'm not okay with is my wife sees this dragging on as an okay reason for her to just be a pain in my ass too on top of it all. Well, I'm trying to actually do something to help people. This is a prime excuse of, well, see, you say you're disabled. And yeah, the government said you're disabled, but T-Mobile obviously doesn't care, and they're not going to get in trouble with the government. It just turns into one big pass changing nightmare. The people in the Westworth Village store that got me the iPhone 15 were as kind as they could be. They really were. It doesn't change that they did not make any attempt or offer to actually make a reasonable accommodation as I had originally requested at the other store. I was just to such a point emotionally dealing with the problems I had, trying to communicate effectively with my wife and daughter, uh, on the pixel that I 

Participant
Uh-huh. 

You
just wanted to be done with it, and they were very kind about that. It doesn't change, that they discriminated against me, never actually tried to resolve the problem. But they were really nice about how they did it. Does that make sense? 

Participant
That does, that does, so, so they tried, even though they asked you, which was as a violation, but, at the same time, they did have that sincere, you know, you know, basically, you know, customer service to help you 

You
Well, 

Participant
out, you 

You
yeah, 

Participant
know, with 

You
I'll go 

Participant
that. 

You
with that in the same way that uh, people from Texas, when they say, bless your heart. Maybe they're saying it because they're being 

Participant
Not 

You
really nice. 

Participant
the very not the yes. That is the a ton you know terminology. I yes that is you know it in some cultures not so much but yes in Texas and in the 

You
Yes, 

Participant
south I 

You
I 

Participant
I 

You
see. 

Participant
see your 

You
Okay. 

Participant
point in regard to that. 

You
So. 

Participant
And 

You
No, 

Participant
and that well go on. 

You
I'm sorry, go ahead. Follow me. 

Participant
No, no, so, but thank you so much again for providing this information to me, so, the very 1st store with the whole situation, we, um, again, feedback has been submitted. I understand you also reached out, you know, through the accessibility department, in regards of nature, but I definitely want to provide, you know, a fair, you know, resolution, you know, because of this whole situation, this matter, now, but I also just want to indicate, though, um, a couple of things, now, in regards to the accessibility act. Now, I just want to just reiterate, what happens is, you know, the basically, you know, this, the, per T-Mobiles, you know, overall um terms for the accessibility, we do have the options, you know, where, if you need, you know, like, if you need assisted with like, you know, billing statements, you know, braille, you know, vision and pairs, stuff of that nature. However, it does not if there's not an accommodation for a financial exception, you know, based upon, except, accessibility act, you know, causing financial 

You
You 

Participant
hardship, 

You
might, 

Participant
but, 

You
I 

Participant
again. 

You
would redirect you to considering uh, the Fair Housing Act and its aspects of the ADA as suitable 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
precedent. I'm not a lawyer by any means. I've told you that already. I'm a medic, but I'm also not somebody that's willing to put myself through hell. For no reason at all, which means when I sent you all the communications that I did indicating that the ADA would likely consider the aspects of the Fair Housing Act and the fact that credit rating, when directly impacted by your disability, is considered a reasonable accommodation, that wasn't some arbitrary wild guess or shot in the dark, so. Well. 

Participant
Gotcha, gotcha. No, and and thank you for bringing that to our attention again, but I just want to also advise, and and I can send you out, you know, an email with my contact information, and then we'll go ahead and provide you, you know, with the accessibility act that we have here with T-Mobile. You know, because again, we do take this very seriously, but unfortun- you know, but unfortunately, you know, T-Mobile does not have an obligation under the ADA, you know, or any other law to, you know, offer any type of financial exception as an accommodation. But I, I definitely want to help you out though, you know, because again, especially with the overall experience that you have received, which is wrong, 100% unethical. You know, and we take, like I mentioned, and I'm appalled for what had happened, you know, especially, you know, people asking, what's your disability? That is a huge No, you know, in regards to this, but I wanted, you know, provide, you know, a kind of a resolution overall for the situation. You know, does that make sense so 

You
Yeah. 

Participant
far? All right. perfect perfect perfect Now, I do, I didn't know about visual audit on my end, on your account, and I noticed that, you know, you did return the Google pixel 

You
Yeah. 

Participant
back, on top of that when you return the Google pixel, you were charged a $70 restocking fee. You know when you returned it back. Because of this whole inconvenience and experience that you had with the Google Pixel. What I would like to do is go ahead and apply a credit uh you know towards your account of $70 for the restocking fee. You know, because again, it's not your fault, you know, what you were going through, and I understand you to go ahead and get the Apple iPhone, um they purchased from the from the different store. On top of that, when you return back um the Google pixel, you also return back the case. So the equipment installment plants for those have been closed out. However, I am showing here, the screen protector was not because again, it was applied towards the phone, so it was an un, so they're basically you weren't able to return back the screen protector. I don't want you to get charged for something you know on your account. That you no longer have especially if it's attached to a phone that you return back. So with that being said is, I'll be more than happy to re- close out the equipment astronomy plan that you have for the screen protector for the actual Google pixel. 

You
Okay. 

Participant
Does 

You
Yeah. 

Participant
that make sense so far? All right, so I'm gonna go, so I'm gonna do that, and then, in addition, again, like I mentioned, we don't, you know, if you want to upgrade, you know, you can definitely take advantage of the T live app. you know, we have a lot of amazing offers. Now, we're not able to, you know, remove or, you know, up opposite the overall down payment, you know, if you want to get an actual Apple Watch per se. However, again, I, I want to go outside the box for you because, you know, again, I, this is, you know, when I was reading your overall correspondence, I was just in shock of what had happened. But what I would like to do because again, you've been, you know, you've started this account. I'm showing here, you have a bill, that's due of $106. So I already offered. I was going to do a $70 credit because you were charge 3 stalking fee, and then but, because of the inconvenience that you had experience, what I'll be more than happy to do is apply the $106 additionally to go ahead and cover your very 1st month bill. So that, so what that means for you is, basically I'm going to be a pint of total credit on your account of $176. 

You
Okay. 

Participant
So when I do that, it's gonna update your account with a credit balance of $70 towards your account. Does that make sense so 

You
Yeah. 

Participant
far 

You
Oh, 

Participant
or what are your thoughts? 

You
I'm waiting to see where this is headed because ultimately, the reason I asked for the devices that I did is because I used them for medical monitoring and I'm 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
using them in development of the platform that my business was created for. So I'm just trying to figure out where this is headed, but by all means. 

Participant
All right. So well let me go ahead and do that for you but no I I understand you know where you know your your overall stands in the in what's happening real quick as well but let me go ahead and get that applied for you real 

You
Okay. 

Participant
quick. So I'm gonna go ahead and get that close. And of course, you can see this directly on my T-Mobile dot com or not, or on the T-Live app, but I'm gonna go ahead and close out the equipment strong plan for the 

You
Yeah, 

Participant
Google 

You
your 

Participant
Pixel screen 

You
phone. 

Participant
protector. 

You
Okay. 

Participant
So I'm doing that right now for you. All right so I'm gonna go ahead and do that. Give me one moment. 

You
You actually caught me in a good time. I was getting ready to walk out the door to the grocery store, so we just sat back down. My wife and daughter are out of town this weekend. Yeah. 

Participant
Oh really? All right I'm going to go ahead and get that closed. Give me one moment will I go ahead and do that? All right, so are they going to go ahead and get that closed out for you and that's going to be for the screen protector? 

You
Okay. 

Participant
All right, and then I'm gonna go ahead and apply the overall credit towards your account. Now, do you still want, you know, to see about gain an Apple Watch? 

You
Ma'am, I can barely walk, because I have cracked vertebrae. I have muscle damage throughout my body. I have nerve damage throughout my legs, hips, 

Participant
Oh 

You
and 

Participant
wow. 

You
arms. I can barely make it up and down my stairs, and I have to use a mobility aid. When I walked in there that day and asked for help with the watch and said, hey, I don't have a problem paying for it. Just, you know, I need y'all to ease up a little bit about the credit because it's directly related to my disability. It wasn't for 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
some luxury item. I fell down my stairs at least once a week. It's 

Participant
Oh wow. 

You
a medical monitoring device because I have seizures. So. 

Participant
Oh my goodness. Sounds 

You
Yeah, 

Participant
that sounds very painful you're going through. 

You
it is. And that's not something that I'm supposed to have to need to disclose, but as 

Participant
Mhm no, 

You
we are 

Participant
no 

You
here, 

Participant
you don't have 

You
I 

Participant
to. 

You
don't have the credit to be able to bypass y'all's credit rating at the moment. I was homeless for 33 months while I waited on the United States of America to acknowledge that a 1st responder was injured in the line of duty and could no longer work. 

Participant
Mm okay. Gotcha. Okay, well I, so, I, I understand that sounds very painful you're having to go through. So, I just want to reiterate, so you're, you're wanting to go ahead and see about getting an Apple Watch, but at the same time, you know, there is like that down payment, you know, you want to see what we can do in regards that, correct? I just wanna make sure we're on the 

You
Yes, 

Participant
right page. 

You
that was what I'd asked for with the reasonable accommodation under, I believe it's either title 2 or 3 of the ADA when I went into the store and your store manager made fun of me and compared to what I was asking for for my medical monitoring to going to Walmart and demanding a TV because I got hurt at work. 

Participant
Mhm. Gotcha. okay. Now what watch were you looking at when you were at the store? 

You
The Apple Watch Ultra 2, the one that is the highest rated and covers the most medical monitoring. It's also set up for Apple intelligence, which I work in AI now, and that's what my company's doing, and the whole reason I 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
ended up in that was because my old Apple Watch Ultra one was when I started developing AI technology for medical monitoring. 

Participant
Gosh okay. So you're looking for the Apple Watch Ultra, you know, and I'm looking, so that's gonna be the Apple Watch Ultra 

You
Yeah. 

Participant
2, the 64 

You
Yes. 

Participant
gig, 

You
Uh, 

Participant
the one that's basically 799. 

You
I'm not looking at your website offhand, but Think 

Participant
Okay. 

You
so? 

Participant
Gotcha okay. 

You
See if I can get y'all site pulled up real quick just because I don't have all my stuff 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
sitting out in front of me. 

Participant
Right. Yeah, because I did take a look into that watch and I'm showing here the down payment for that it is going to be about 6 $611 

You
Walnut. 

Participant
plus the 

You
Considering 

Participant
taxes, you 

You
I 

Participant
know. 

You
can't repair the monitor I had to replace on my laptop, that cost 

Participant
Mhm. 

You
that exact same amount. That's going to end up being a little bit problematic for me 

Participant
Right. 

You
being able to monitor my medical conditions 

Participant
Right. 

You
and my fault. 

Participant
Gotcha, I understand. So, now, here with T-Mobile. um again we you know. We're you're basically your service provider. You know, you can get your, you can get equipment through T-Mobile. Um, he has a down payment, maybe it be applied, plus the taxes, and of course, you could put it on 24 month instrumment plans. And then on top of that, you know, but of course you can also get equipment, you know, via 3rd party, you know, via Apple, um, directly, you know, even on Amazon, you know, 

You
Yeah, 

Participant
as long as it's compatible with our 

You
I'm 

Participant
network. 

You
aware of that. 

Participant
Now. Now, as far, you know, so again, we don't subsidize the equipment, you know, because again, there's no service. There's no contract as far as with a penalty if you were to cancel if you want to get the device, the account payment will, you know, maybe assess. Now. What I can do again because again, we are your service provider. You know, I already offered. I was going to go ahead and do a credit towards your account, you know, for, you know, basically reimburse you for the $70 restocking fee, covering your very 1st month's bill that you have of $106. When I take a look into your normal monthly reoccurring charges with your iPhone 15. Your normal bill, you know, because you're on the experience more, you have the protection plan that protects your iPhone that also includes AppleCare for 2 years. So your normal month, your reoccurring charges estimated with taxes, about 142 and ¢43. So, what I can do again, and this, this is something we normally don't do, especially like I mentioned, you know, earlier, T-Mobile does not have an obligation under the ADA to offer any kind of financial exception or accommodation, but I understand where you're coming from. So I'm not able to remove or discount or or update the actual down payment for the phone. However, what I can do, you know, I I definitely want to go outside the box, is I can go ahead. I'm I gonna I already gonna go ahead and do the $106 and the 70 but I can apply another month of service credit of $142. Actually just rounded up. I was gonna go ahead and make it even 145. And you know, in addition to what I was already gonna go ahead and offer as a credit. So with that being said, so if you think about it, that's $70 +106 +145 that would be a total credit of $321. Now, I'm not able to, like I mentioned, I'm not able to, you know, remove or offset the down payment, but if you think about it, you're not gonna have a bill for this month and you're not gonna have a bill for next 

You
Ma'am. 

Participant
month. 

You
Can 

Participant
You know 

You
I 

Participant
that 

You
ask you, 

Participant
way. 

You
can I ask you something? If 

Participant
Yeah. 

You
you were humiliated in a store while you were sitting there, explaining how you're developing technology to keep 1st responders alive, and you had to walk out of there crying and in shame. How would $300 sound to you? What if it was your kid? What if it was one of your colleagues? What if I came to your home when you called 911 and I treated your mother with the level of respect your employees treated a 1st responder with? Who, again, came to you in good faith, because your business professes a deep love for its disabled community, its small business owner community, and its 1st responder community. All 3 of which I'm a very proud member of. How 

Participant
Right. 

You
would you feel about that? Especially 

Participant
No, 

You
when on top of 

Participant
no. 

You
that, I still have regulatory costs associated with my development. I have the actual hardware and compute cost for the development, and I still have to go out and buy the devices I need for continue development because you're willing to give me a 

Participant
uh-huh. 

You
discount on my bill when I ask for something that is a medical necessity for my monitoring and well-being and happens to align directly with what my business I brought to your organization, it was even created for. I'm not trying to be disrespectful 

Participant
Understand. 

You
to you at all, ma'am, but I am saying, think about how I must feel sitting here listening to you repeatedly tell me how the federal law doesn't apply. To this. But it does everything else, just not this 

Participant
Mhm 

You
right here, while I'm having to make sure I stay very clearly within the confines of federal law, because I'm developing a technology, that people are a little apprehensive about it at the moment, and I have to make sure they feel safe when that technology comes into their home with one of my fellow 1st responders. 

Participant
Understand, you know, and I, I understand, I, I would feel, you know, I, I'm putting myself into your shoes, again, I have done that, you know, I, I also have my mom, she is, you know, disabled, you know, she's handicapped, so I get where you're coming from, and regard this whole situation. I would feel bad, you know, if my mom would do the same thing you did. But I definitely want to go above and beyond because of your experience. I'm not able to change what had happened, but again, we do take this very seriously, and we did go ahead and submit the appropriate feedback because of this whole situation. Now, but I understand, you know, you need this, you know, especially with, you know, what's going on. You know, you need the wash, especially to go ahead and have that with your health. So, I'm not like I mentioned, we're not able to discount the actual device or the down payment, but what I'm trying to do is apply it as a bill credit basically to help you, you know, 

You
I'll 

Participant
if you want to get the 

You
tell you 

Participant
watch, 

You
what. At 

Participant
you can go ahead. 

You
the moment, I need to get to the grocery store because I do have 

Participant
Okay. 

You
to get stuff for dinner and all. Why don't we take the weekend? I'll run it by my peers in the EMS community and get their thoughts on it. I mean, I'm in direct interaction with them constantly anyways because of responder OS and getting their feedback on the development of it. So, I'll put it out there and see if maybe I'm just a little emotionally charged about it and we'll circle back in a couple of days and visit again and see what the verdict of the 1st responder community is. 

Participant
Understand. Well let me ask you this. Do you want me to, I already offered this, I was secured the $70 a stography in this month, would you like me to do that for now, and then with the addition of the 

You
I 

Participant
145 or do 

You
was 

Participant
you, 

You
under 

Participant
which 

You
the 

Participant
I'm going to 

You
intention 

Participant
hold off on 

You
that 

Participant
that? 

You
you had already done that because that's what you said you had done. Maybe 

Participant
Right. 

You
I 

Participant
Yes, you're 

You
misunderstood. 

Participant
right Well, no. So I'm gonna apply the 70 plus the 106 now but I have not applied the additional 2nd month of the 145. 

You
Well, I'll tell you what, we'll talk about that after I get done talking to my colleagues. 

Participant
Okay, so as of right now, just to reiterate, just to recap, so I applied a total credit towards your account, and that's gonna be for the amount of, 176, and on top of that, I closed out the equipment installment plan for the Google Pixel screen 

You
That 

Participant
protector. 

You
is correct. You. Resolved, 

Participant
Alright perfect. And 

You
Discrimination, 

Participant
then. 

You
humiliation, and ostracization of a disabled public servant with $170 and a very kind phone call. I appreciate it. I'll give y'all a call Monday. 

Participant
I I would if you like I I'll be more happy to get here and give you a call on Monday. Is there a particular time I can reach out to you on Monday? 

You
Uh, anytime after about one o'clock, but not um, after 330 because I have to go pick my daughter up. She gets off work at 4. And so I try to 

Participant
right. 

You
make sure I'm well prepared for that point. 

Participant
You got it. You got it. I definitely won't go ahead and reach actually after one PM your time but before 4 o'clock your time. 

You
Okay. 

Participant
between those 

You
Okay, 

Participant
hours. 

You
thank you. 

Participant
All 

You
We'll talk then. 

Participant
right, perfect. you very welcome. I'm excited to have yourself a good weekend 

You
You 

Participant
Robert take 

You

Participant
care. 

You

Participant
Thank you bye-bye.
